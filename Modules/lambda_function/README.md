## Introduction

The AWS Lambda Function project aims to provide an automated way to provision and manage a serverless function on AWS using the AWS Lambda service. AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for executing your code in response to events.

## Usage

To use this Terraform configuration for deploying an AWS Lambda function, follow these steps:

1. Configure variables: Open the `variables.tf` file and adjust the variables according to your requirements and any other necessary variables to customize your Lambda function.
2. Define the Lambda function: Open the `main.tf` file and define the AWS Lambda function resource using the variables specified in the `variables.tf` file. Customize the resource configuration based on your specific use case.
3. Configure outputs: Open the `output.tf` file and define any desired outputs for the Lambda function. This could include information such as the function's ARN, name, or any other relevant details.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the Terraform documentation:
