## Introduction

The AWS Subnet project aims to provide an automated way to provision and manage subnets on AWS using Terraform. Subnets are essential for networking in AWS, allowing you to segregate and isolate resources within your virtual private cloud (VPC).

## Usage

To use this Terraform configuration for creating and managing subnets on AWS, follow these steps:

1. Configure variables: Open the `variables.tf` file and adjust the variables according to your requirements.
2. Define the subnet: Open the `main.tf` file and define the AWS subnet resource using the variables specified in the `variables.tf` file.
3. Configure outputs: Open the `output.tf` file and define any desired outputs for the subnet. This could include information such as the subnet ID, CIDR block, or any other relevant details.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the Terraform documentation:
